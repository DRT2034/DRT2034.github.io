Hi, I’m Arthur

As I write this, in early 2026, I’m 25 years old. 
I’m in my last year of a master statistics, and generally enjoy dabbling in ideas. 

I never saw myself writing a blog, though. So what changed? 

Over the past years, I’ve noticed I often circle the same ideas over and over again. I never fully develop them and write them down, so they often remain fuzzy and immature. An experiment I wanted to try out in the middle of last year was therefore to start writing things down. Really writing out and externalizing ideas. These can range from the building of a personal philosophy to technical topics I’ve always been interested but never explored. 

The blog then comes in as a way to ‘publish’ these thoughts. The idea of publishing forces me to develop these ideas to a point where they’re actually coherent enough for someone else to read. Or more accurately, as the number of people ever reading this is limited to my girlfriend, to develop these ideas until I feel at ease with the fact that this combination of words came out of my brain. 

The fact that these ideas were never developed also means that this blog is the perfect place to put down a semi-finished idea, and then later when I read another book or get a sudden insight, I can amend them structurally. This isn’t really possible when everything remains in my head. It’s been a missing piece, however, as I have the tendency to change my opinion on things quite a lot. I can say something in conversation, and a day later wake up and realize I talked complete nonsense, or shouldn’t have been so *certain* in the way I expressed my stance. Generally it’s never a good idea to express your stance about loose topics in a certain manner, because if the right person is at the other end of the table, they’ll challenge you on something you don’t know nor care that much about.

All of these ideas in this blog are coming from me. That means this blog is the perfect I/O platform. It’s an extension of my brain where input is turned into output. They’re “Inference Based On a Sample of One”, though, which is where the name IBOS1 comes from. This name also implies that there’s a lot of variability possible in other people’s experience with these same topics. This variability isn’t taken into account with my limited model. So be warned. 

Happy reading!
