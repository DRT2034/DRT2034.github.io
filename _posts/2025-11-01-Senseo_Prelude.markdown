A thought exercise I’ve been engaging in since I was a little boy is that of the time machine game: what if I was teleported back in time some 500 years, or better 5000 years? What exactly would I be able to produce that the people of that period didn’t know how to produce themselves. What would be my competitive advantage and how exactly am I a master of my own time period? 

We often take for granted the devices we use on a daily basis, such as phones, laptops, coffee machines, refrigerators and so on. Which of those modern day devices do you know thoroughly enough to reproduce on your own, with nothing other than raw materials? Do you even know which raw materials you’d need in order to get started? 

If you were truly teleported back in time and cannot produce a single thing the locals produce themselves, should you really take pride in the progress you claim our society is making? Are you a fundamental pillar of that society? 

Now I know I wouldn’t be able to produce anything worthwhile, and this kind of makes sense. In our current system of education, we’re taught from a young age how to reject our natural impulses in return for an occupation of study. One where all children alike conform to a similar form of study that gets them on track to get into higher education, which in turn has the goal of specializing them into someone that can adequately play their part in institutions or corporations. That’s the way a society functions, each person specializes in such a way they can contribute as best they can to the whole. This isn’t done out of altruism, but instead out of self interest. Specialization allows a person to compete, meaning to entice more demand for than there is supply of his labor, in turn getting him those perks he desires. 

Now this specialization has a downside, one that Adam Smith warned about very clearly when describing the invisible hand. The worker that is trained at performing singular tasks well can generally become so specialized that, when taken out of the environment of his specialization, he becomes worthless and ignorant. In simplistic terms, he who makes dials on the assembly line never learns how the clock itself functions. When he inevitably encounters someone and proudly tells of his profession in the watchmaking industry, he scarcely knows what makes the watch tick. Such is the nature of capitalism, which produces on the one hand a tremendous amount of welfare and innovation, and on the other imposes upon the us certain threats that need handling on the individual level.

*“The man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations, of which the effects too are, perhaps, always the same, or very nearly the same, has no occasion to exert his understanding, or to exercise his invention in finding out expedients for removing difficulties which never occur. He naturally loses, therefore, the habit of such exertion, and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become”* (The Wealth of Nations, book V, p.840)

Another great book I read where this sentiment is echoed is ‘On Liberty’ by John Stuart Mill, who writes: *“He who lets the world, or his own portion of it, choose his plan of life for him, has no need of any other faculty than the ape-like one of imitation. He who chooses his plan for himself, employs all his faculties. He must use observation to see, reasoning and judgment to foresee, activity to gather materials for decision, discrimination to decide, and when he has decided, firmness and self control to hold to his deliberate decision - Human nature is not a machine to be built after a model, and set to do exactly the work prescribed for it, but a tree, which requires to grow and develop itself on all sides, according to the tendency of the inward forces which make it a living thing”.*

Only at the individual level are we able to battle those imposing forces, and despite the modern day consensus that individuals bear little responsibility for the way their lives turns out, it remains the foremost necessity for each one of us to become the captain of their ship, which entails digging into the working of all that is around us. 

## The machine 

Apart from those philosophical rationalizations I've alluded to, I recently got curious and took apart my Senseo machine to see what’s inside. It turns out there are several components that lay at the basis of making me a cup in the morning.

 I’d say there are six essential components, namely electricity, a printing plate, a boiler, a pump, a valve system and extraction chemistry. We'll start with electricity.
