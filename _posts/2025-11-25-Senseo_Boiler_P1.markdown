This next chapter is one I’m very much quite interested in, as truly the only way I can imagine making water heat up is by creating a fire and putting a pot of water from a stream on it.

When we take apart the Senseo machine, this is also the first thing we see. It’s a big white container in the middle of the machine, connected to valves and the pump (at the bottom). Luckily I didn’t have to cut my boiler open to see this, as our good friend Wikipedia has an image showing this magnificent sight. This whole outer plastic is usually filled with water.

But now to the real question, how do we go from cold water to warm or even hot water? Going from nothing to something? Perhaps we can again start from atoms and molecules. Water is made from H2O atoms, and a lot of them (molecules) make up a body of water. As seen in early physics classes, when water is cold, these molecules move slowly, when heated they move faster. So the idea of heating (or boiling) water is just to make the molecules move fast enough. If I’d use the caveman method, I’d collect some wood, start a fire [through friction](https://www.wikihow.com/Start-a-Fire-with-Sticks). When wood is burning, the chemical energy the wood holds is released as heat upon combining with oxygen. This heat rises and touches the pot, into the material of it. That material itself gets hot and warms the water. 

A typical problem with this method is that most energy that’s created gets lost, only a little touches the pot and even less results in accomplishing the goal of heating water (indirect heating). The goal is therefore to capture all that released energy.
